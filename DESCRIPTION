Description: Performs goodness of fits tests for both high and low-dimensional linear models.
    It can test for a variety of model misspecifications including nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity.
    In addition one can test the significance of potentially large groups of variables, and also
    produce p-values for the significance of individual variables in high-dimensional linear
    regression.
